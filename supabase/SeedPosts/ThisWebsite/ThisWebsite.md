For any software/web developer it becomes clear at some point that putting code down is the easiest part. Though pretty fundamental, code is hardly the be all and end all. Concerns like `documentation`, `maintainabily` and `design patterns` are equally critical for a good code base. 

Guess I'll use this project for what its meant by having it be documented on itself :3

To start, the project is split into 2 main components. Commonly known as `Backend(BE)` and `Frontend(FE)`. Each being responsible for a specialised role, they are inevitably separated by oceans.

### Backend
In this project, I am using [Supabase](https://supabase.com) to serve as backend, it comes packed with a [Postgress](https://www.postgresql.org) database and provides core boilerplate systems such as `Authentication`, `Storage` and `Edge Functions`.

Simultaneously it provides a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) implementation simplifying API interactions without the need to code any of it myself.

### Frontend
This has been my element for quite a time now, I wou'nt go as far as to say I am an authority but I should have the know-how to layout whats going on here in substantial detail.

Using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) to componentise the presentation of the website and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) to minimise the amount of CSS Ill need to type out. 

Otherwise this should be pretty straight forward in terms of the systemic layout.
